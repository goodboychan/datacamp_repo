    "# Neural Networks\n",
    "> The previous chapters taught you how to build models in TensorFlow 2.0. In this chapter, you will apply those same tools to build, train, and make predictions with neural networks. You will learn how to define dense layers, apply activation functions, select an optimizer, and apply regularization to reduce overfitting. You will take advantage of TensorFlow's flexibility by using both low-level linear algebra and high-level Keras API operations to define and train models. This is the Summary of lecture \"Introduction to TensorFlow in Python\", via datacamp.\n",

We can see that the model performs reasonably-well, but does so by overpredicting non-default. This suggests that we may need to train longer, tune the model's hyperparameters, or change the model's architecture."
